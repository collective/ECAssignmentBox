# Todos for release 1.4

- Email notification on workflow transition 'grade' and notification
  for box creators is still untested.  

- The action/button 'set assignment box options' on ECFolder's content
  tab is still missing.  That means it's not possible to modify the
  submission period and other settings for more than one assignment box
  at a time.

- Migration of 'ECAssignmentBox' content from Plone 2.x has not been 
  tested extensively.


# Todos for release 1.5

- 'ECAssignmentTask' has not been integrated.

- The more experimental 'PlagDetector' has not been integrated.
