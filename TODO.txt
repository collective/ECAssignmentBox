# Todos for release 1.4 (2008-12-04)

- Email notification on workflow transition 'grade' and notification
  for box creators is still untested.  

- The action/button 'set assignment box options' on ECFolder's content
  tab is still missing.  That means it's not possible to modify the
  submission period and other settings for more than one assignment box
  at a time.

- Migration of 'ECAssignmentBox' content from Plone 2.x has not been 
  tested.

- Collapsible box for direction text in 'ECAssignmentBox' and 
  assignment text in 'ECAssignment' cannot be expanded.

- 'ECAssignmentTask' have not been integrated.

- The more experimental 'PlagDetector' have not been integrated.
